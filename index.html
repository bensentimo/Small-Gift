                        To my dearest era, happy happy happy 18th bideet!! It's already been 18 years since you were born, and those years have been challenging, but as adulthood welcomes you, I hope you have enough courage and patience to face it. Even though you may face problems, please do remember that you have me, you have your friends who are willing to be your wall.

Thank you rin for listening to my super duper cringey na long stories about my rants and crushes and also for giving advices hehehehehe (lalo na yung kay 3yrsüòù) And to our memories outside acads, the super stressful MAPS. From volunteering up until the last event of MAPS, I am thankful that I am with you. Thank you for agreeing to be a volunteer and to be an officer in an org with me hihihihi. Thank you for pushing my limits whenever I have a challenging task, especially the math clinic event. I hope that you will treasure our org's memories. Again, happy birthday! I am so proud of you. I hope that you will achieve all of your dreams, I hope that you will still continue all the things that you love, and lastly, I also hope that we are still friends even after decades ü•µ. Always take care of yourself mwaaaps ^^

                        HAPPY LEGALITY TO THE ONE AND ONLY JULIA A. OF USL!ü•≥üíó

First of all, as someone who‚Äôs already in a legal age, all I can say is at some point, it somehow feels scary if you just think that you‚Äôre almost 18 leaving behind your minor years. However, being 18 will made you realize some things. 

Things like, freedom and maturity. But for you Juls, being with you for almost 2 years, I can say that you are mature enough for your current age. You are well aware of everything around you. You are very expressive when it comes to your own views and opinions. You have your own way to do things that you want to do. Lastly, you‚Äôre one of the creative person that I know. All of those, that‚Äôs what I love about you.

Wishing you a good healthy lifestyle, success in life, and of course to celebrate and enjoy more of your future birthdays. I love you so much Julesüíó We love you so much and I pray for the best for youüíó Happy 18th Birthday again!ü•≥üíó

<br>"Our Museum"
<br>
<br>a ride home, standing still in the midst of the crowd.
a peaceful silence when you are around.
from city to city that we have surround;
even if we partways we'll be back on the same ground.<br>

<br>art is a birthright and you made it your own.
a decade and eighth year of exhibit is a salient milestone.
for the past six years that we have grown.
yet we are still who we are, its a nostalgic clone.<br>

<br>take care of your hues and use it for freedom,
write your own story and your addendum.
under the colosseum, you are building your spoliarium.
more than a home, you are our museum.<br>

18th!! Oh my god, such a milestone. July, a Larkspur baby‚Äîlightness and an open heart, somehow encapsulates who you are. While change is the only thing permanent is this world, I hope you don't lose those fragments and colors that makes you; you. Happiest Birthday to you, Julia. You've offered such stability in MAPS, one of the first peeps I got comfy with nung nabiktima ako ni Anne nung Org fair. Things do get tough past 18 but hey, you do have you own slice of heaven (gets mo? omg such a poet, I am.) And you're a toughie, you'll do well, even during the times when you feel like you aren't. 

Enjoy your day! ü•≥ü•∞
